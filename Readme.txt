Gentelella is a responsive, flat and fully featured admin template. 
This neat site canvas is built on Bootstrap 3 framework using modern techniques, like HTML5 and CSS3 to be used for backend solutions of any size. 
This is by far the most advanced and well designed free admin dashboard template that can easily compete with any premium alternative.
 And once you introduce your creative touch to it, the options go over and beyond. Indeed, there is no need to stick to the default settings. 
Still, if you dig Gentellela as is, go full-tilt with the existing layout.

Moreover, Gentellela has handy libraries included in the bundle for calendar, tables, charts, off-canvas navigation and more. 
Additional features include but are not limited to progress bars, notifications, animations and forms.
 With future updates, you can also expect even more out of Gentellela.
